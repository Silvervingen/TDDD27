## Description

The purpose of the website is to offer a platform for users to keep track of the games they like. This can be useful for players who want a list of the games they have played or the games they want to play in the future. By creating an account and adding games to their list, users can keep track of which games they have played, which games they have liked, and which games they want to play next.

The website will have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. Users will be able to search for games by title, genre, or platform and add games to their list of tracked games. They will also be able to create customized lists to organize their tracked games in a way that makes sense to them. For example, they can create a list of all the games they want to play in the future, a list of their favorite games, or a list of games they have completed.

In addition to tracking games, users will be able to see detailed information about each game, including a description and price. This information will be retrieved from the RAWG Video Games Database API, which ensures that the information is accurate and up-to-date.
